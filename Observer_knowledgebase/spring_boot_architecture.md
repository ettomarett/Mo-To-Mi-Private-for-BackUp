# Spring Boot Monolithic Architecture

## 1. Architecture and Structure

Spring Boot monoliths typically follow a layered architecture pattern with several distinct layers:

### Layered Pattern
- **Controllers** (top layer): Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services** (middle layer): Contain business logic
- **Repositories** (data access layer): Interface with databases
- **Entities** (domain objects): Represent business data

### Request Flow
A typical request flows:
```
Client → Controller → Service → Repository → Database → Response
```

### Component Scanning & Dependency Injection
- `@SpringBootApplication` on the main class enables `@ComponentScan`
- Spring automatically detects components in the root package and subpackages
- Annotated beans (`@Component`, `@Service`, etc.) are auto-registered
- Dependencies are injected via constructor (preferred) or field injection
- Beans are singleton-scoped by default (one instance per context)

### Package Layouts

#### Package-by-Layer
Organizes code by technical function:
```
com.example.app
  ├── controller/
  ├── service/
  ├── repository/
  ├── entity/
  └── config/
```

#### Package-by-Feature (Recommended)
Organizes code by business domain:
```
com.shop
  ├── user/
  │   ├── controller/
  │   ├── service/
  │   ├── repository/
  │   └── model/
  └── product/
      ├── controller/
      ├── service/
      ├── repository/
      └── model/
```

Package-by-feature increases modularity and cohesion while reducing coupling.

### Identifying Service Boundaries
When analyzing a monolith for potential microservice boundaries:

1. **Package Structure Analysis**:
   - Package-by-feature often provides natural service boundaries
   - Top-level packages often represent potential bounded contexts
   - Heavily nested packages may indicate complex domains requiring further analysis

2. **Coupling Metrics**:
   - **Afferent Coupling (Ca)**: Number of classes outside a package that depend on classes within it
   - **Efferent Coupling (Ce)**: Number of classes inside a package that depend on classes outside it
   - **Instability (I)**: Calculated as Ce/(Ca+Ce), ranges from 0 (stable) to 1 (unstable)
   - Packages with high stability (low I) are good candidates for core microservices

3. **Data Dependencies**:
   - Entity relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N) indicate data coupling
   - Strong entity relationships suggest keeping related entities in the same service
   - Weak entity relationships (those used only for reference) suggest potential separation points

## 2. Spring Boot Component Breakdown

### Core Annotations

#### `@RestController`
- Specialized `@Controller` that assumes `@ResponseBody` on methods
- Handles HTTP requests and automatically serializes responses to JSON
- Used with `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc. to map endpoints

#### `@Service`
- Marks classes in the service/business layer
- Indicates where transaction and business logic should reside
- Auto-detected as a Spring bean

#### `@Repository`
- Marks data access layer classes
- Often extends `JpaRepository` or similar
- Spring applies automatic exception translation
- Encapsulates database CRUD operations

#### `@Component`
- Generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component
- Parent annotation for `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`
- Used for utility or factory classes

#### `@Entity`
- JPA annotation marking persistent domain objects
- Maps class to database table
- Class fields map to table columns
- Works with `@Id`, `@Column`, etc. for detailed mapping

### Bean Scopes and Lifecycles
- **Singleton** (default): One instance per application context
- **Prototype**: New instance for each injection
- **Web-aware**: Request, session scopes are available
- **Lifecycle hooks**: `@PostConstruct`, `InitializingBean` for initialization

### Detecting Component Relationships

When analyzing a Spring Boot application, look for these relationship patterns:

1. **Constructor/Field Injection**:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class OrderService {
       private final ProductService productService;
       private final UserService userService;
       
       // Constructor injection shows dependencies
       public OrderService(ProductService productService, UserService userService) {
           this.productService = productService;
           this.userService = userService;
       }
   }
   ```
   
2. **Service-to-Repository Dependencies**:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class ProductService {
       private final ProductRepository productRepo;
       // Constructor injection
   }
   ```

3. **Controller-to-Service Dependencies**:
   ```java
   @RestController
   public class OrderController {
       private final OrderService orderService;
       // Constructor injection
   }
   ```

4. **Cross-Domain Dependencies**:
   When services from one domain package depend on services from another domain package:
   ```java
   // This indicates coupling between domains
   @Service
   public class OrderService {
       private final ProductService productService; // Cross-domain dependency
       private final PaymentService paymentService; // Cross-domain dependency
   }
   ```

## 3. Best Practices for Maintainable Monoliths

### Modular Package Design
- Organize by feature/domain (not by layer)
- Each feature package forms a bounded context
- Clear APIs between modules reduce coupling
- Spring Modulith supports formal module boundaries

### Separation of Concerns
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Controllers handle only HTTP concerns
- Services implement business logic
- Repositories handle data access only
- High cohesion within classes, loose coupling between them

### Clean Architecture / Layering
```
com.shop.cart
   ├── domain/model/            # Core business entities
   ├── domain/repository/       # Repository interfaces
   ├── application/service/     # Service interfaces
   ├── application/service/impl/# Service implementations 
   ├── infrastructure/controller/ # Web adapters
   └── infrastructure/repository/ # DB adapters
```

### Configuration & Profiles
- Use `application.properties` or `application.yml` 
- Environment-specific: `application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`
- Activate profiles via `spring.profiles.active`
- Centralize configuration for easy management

### Use DTOs for APIs
- Don't expose JPA entities directly to clients
- Map entities to DTOs in service layer
- Use MapStruct or ModelMapper to reduce boilerplate
- Encapsulate internal domain model details

### Domain-Driven Design Principles
When identifying service boundaries, look for:

1. **Bounded Contexts**:
   - Areas where specific domain terms have specific meanings
   - Example: "Account" in banking vs. "Account" in user management
   - Often maps to top-level packages in well-designed monoliths

2. **Aggregates**:
   - Clusters of domain objects treated as a unit
   - Example: Order and OrderLine always manipulated together
   - Share a single repository and transaction boundary
   - Good indicators of service boundaries

3. **Context Maps**:
   - Relationships between bounded contexts
   - Pattern types: Partnership, Customer-Supplier, Conformist, etc.
   - Useful for identifying integration patterns between future microservices

## 4. Common Anti-Patterns

### God Classes
- Classes that do too much
- Violate Single Responsibility Principle
- Often have too many methods, fields, dependencies
- Hard to test and maintain
- Example: Service with 50+ methods, multiple responsibilities
- **Detection metrics**: Class with >500 lines, >20 methods, or >10 dependencies

### Feature Entanglement
- Business logic scattered across unrelated packages
- Changes require modifications to multiple components
- Makes code hard to understand and maintain
- Example: User registration logic in user, email, and audit packages
- **Detection**: Methods calling across multiple domain packages

### Over-Shared Repositories
- Same repository used in unrelated contexts
- Creates tight coupling between domains
- Causes confusion about responsibility
- Example: Generic `PersonRepository` used for both customers and employees
- **Detection**: Repository used by services in different domain packages

### Tight Coupling Between Services
- Direct implementation dependencies (vs. interfaces)
- Hard-coded service interactions
- Rigid structure that's resistant to change
- Service-to-service calls creating a web of dependencies
- **Detection**: Circular dependencies between services

### Lack of Clear Boundaries
- No logical separation between domains
- Code from different concerns intermixes freely
- Internal implementation details exposed across modules
- No encapsulation between functional areas
- **Detection**: High afferent and efferent coupling metrics

### Database-Driven Coupling
- Multiple domains sharing tables directly
- Join queries across domain boundaries
- Tight data model integration preventing separation
- **Detection**: JPA @OneToMany/@ManyToMany relationships across domain packages

## 5. Code Examples

### Well-Structured Example (Layered CRUD)

```java
// JPA Entity (domain layer)
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private String username;
    private String email;
    // constructors/getters/setters omitted
}

// Repository (data access layer)
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> { }

// Service (business logic layer)
@Service
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepo;
    
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepo) {
        this.userRepo = userRepo;
    }
    
    public User createUser(User u) {
        // business validation here
        return userRepo.save(u);
    }
    
    public Optional<User> findUser(Long id) {
        return userRepo.findById(id);
    }
}

// REST Controller (presentation layer)
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    private final UserService userSvc;
    
    public UserController(UserService userSvc) {
        this.userSvc = userSvc;
    }

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody User u) {
        User saved = userSvc.createUser(u);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(saved);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<User> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return userSvc.findUser(id)
            .map(ResponseEntity::ok)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND));
    }
}
```

### Anti-Pattern Example

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class BadController {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepo;  // Directly injected data layer

    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User u) {
        // Business logic mixed with controller logic
        if (u.getUsername() == null) {
            throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, "Username required");
        }
        // Directly calling repository from controller
        return userRepo.save(u);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Poor error handling
        User u = userRepo.findById(id).orElse(null);
        if (u == null) {
            throw new RuntimeException("User not found");
        }
        return u;
    }
}
```

### Domain Relationship Example

```java
// Order domain
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final OrderRepository orderRepo;
    private final ProductService productService; // Cross-domain dependency
    private final CustomerService customerService; // Cross-domain dependency
    
    public Order createOrder(OrderRequest req) {
        // Validate customer exists
        Customer customer = customerService.getCustomer(req.getCustomerId());
        
        // Create order
        Order order = new Order();
        order.setCustomer(customer);
        
        // Add products to order
        for (OrderItemRequest item : req.getItems()) {
            Product product = productService.getProduct(item.getProductId());
            OrderItem orderItem = new OrderItem(order, product, item.getQuantity());
            order.addItem(orderItem);
        }
        
        return orderRepo.save(order);
    }
}
```
This example shows strong coupling between Order, Customer, and Product domains, suggesting careful analysis before splitting into microservices.

## 6. Security & Configuration

### Spring Security Setup

```java
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeHttpRequests(authz -> authz
            .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .requestMatchers("/api/**").hasAnyRole("USER","ADMIN")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
        )
        .httpBasic();  // or formLogin(), etc.
    return http.build();
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define roles (ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN)
- Map users to roles
- Restrict endpoints using `hasRole()` or `@PreAuthorize`
- Configure authentication source (in-memory, database, LDAP)

### JWT/Bearer Tokens
For stateless APIs:
```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: http://authserver
```

### CORS Configuration
```java
@RestController
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000")
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ApiController { ... }
```

### Security Boundaries as Service Boundaries
- Security constraints often indicate natural service boundaries
- Authentication domains frequently align with microservice boundaries
- Resource servers in OAuth2 often map to individual microservices
- URL path patterns in security config suggest service groupings

## 7. Testing and Tooling

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation (with mocks)
- **Integration Tests**: Test components working together
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete request flows

### Spring Boot Test Annotations
- **@SpringBootTest**: Loads full application context
- **@WebMvcTest**: Loads only web layer and MockMvc
- **@DataJpaTest**: Loads repositories with in-memory DB
- **@MockBean**: Replace beans with mocked versions

### Example Test
```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class UserControllerTest {
    @Autowired MockMvc mockMvc;
    
    @Test void testGetUser() throws Exception {
        mockMvc.perform(get("/users/1"))
               .andExpect(status().isOk())
               .andExpect(content().contentType("application/json"));
    }
}
```

### Database Testing
- Use Testcontainers for real database containers
- Or H2 in-memory for simple tests
- Configure test-specific DataSource

### API Documentation
- Use Springdoc OpenAPI or Springfox
- Auto-generates API documentation
- Provides Swagger UI for interactive testing

### Test Dependencies for Service Boundaries
- Analyze test class mocking patterns
- Components mocked together suggest strong coupling
- Separate test suites often indicate good separation potential
- High count of @MockBean annotations suggests high coupling

## 8. Real-World Project Examples

### Package-by-Feature Monolith
Example: [mzubal/spring-boot-monolith](https://github.com/mzubal/spring-boot-monolith)
- Features in separate packages
- Internal classes use package-private visibility
- Clear module boundaries even in single deployment

### Layered Architecture with Full Features
Example: [AlekseyBykov/pets.spring-boot-monolith](https://github.com/AlekseyBykov/pets.spring-boot-monolith)
- Multi-tier monolith
- Security, Swagger docs, Actuator
- DTOs with MapStruct
- Production-ready setup

### Spring Modulith
- Official Spring approach to modular monoliths
- API and internal packages per module
- Enforced boundaries via tests
- Example in Spring Blog (e-commerce sample)

### Microservice-Ready Monoliths
Example: [karthik-cbe/springboot-microservice-todeployment](https://github.com/karthik-cbe/springboot-microservice-todeployment)
- Designed with future microservice extraction in mind
- Clear bounded contexts
- Minimized cross-domain dependencies
- Service interfaces for cross-domain communication

## 9. Analyzing for Microservice Extraction

### Dependency Analysis Techniques

1. **Static Analysis**:
   - Analyze import statements to build class dependencies
   - Map service-to-service and service-to-repository dependencies
   - Identify cross-domain method calls
   - Tools: JDepend, Structure101, custom code analyzers

2. **Runtime Analysis**:
   - Trace actual API calls in production
   - Monitor database access patterns
   - Identify frequently accessed endpoints
   - Tools: Spring Boot Actuator, Sleuth, Zipkin

3. **Database Schema Analysis**:
   - Identify entity relationships
   - Map tables to domain models
   - Detect shared database patterns
   - Look for natural data partitioning boundaries

### Extraction Candidate Metrics

1. **Low Coupling Score**:
   - Few dependencies on other packages
   - Well-defined API for external communication
   - Limited shared data access with other domains

2. **High Cohesion Score**:
   - Related functionality grouped together
   - Strong internal relationships
   - Focused on single business capability

3. **Independent Scalability**:
   - Different resource needs than other components
   - Separate performance characteristics
   - Natural scaling boundaries

4. **Business Criticality**:
   - Core vs. supporting functionality
   - Business impact of separate scaling/deployment
   - Independent release cycles beneficial

### Example Domain Distance Matrix
A table showing the "distance" between domains (based on dependencies):

| Domain     | User | Product | Order | Payment | Shipping |
|------------|------|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| User       | -    | 0.2     | 0.5   | 0.7     | 0.9      |
| Product    | 0.2  | -       | 0.3   | 0.8     | 0.6      |
| Order      | 0.5  | 0.3     | -     | 0.4     | 0.3      |
| Payment    | 0.7  | 0.8     | 0.4   | -       | 0.7      |
| Shipping   | 0.9  | 0.6     | 0.3   | 0.7     | -        |

Lower numbers indicate stronger coupling (harder to separate).
Higher numbers suggest easier extraction into separate services.
