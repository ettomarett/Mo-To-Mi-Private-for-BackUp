I should greet them and mention their stored preferences. Maybe ask if they want to add more or discuss something related. Need to keep it friendly and helpful. Also, make sure not to use any tools here since it's just a greeting. Just respond naturally based on the existing memories.\n</think>\n\nHello! I see from my memory that you've previously mentioned liking cucumber, pizza, and mango. Would you like to add any new preferences to remember, or is there something specific you'd like to discuss today?"

I should store this new preference.\n\nBut wait, the rules say I need explicit permission before storing personal info. So I can't just store it automatically. I need to ask the user if they want me to remember this.\n\nSo the correct step is to prompt them: \"Would you like me to remember that you like hummus?\" If they say yes, then I can use the memory tool with has_explicit_permission set to true. Otherwise, I shouldn't store it.\n\nIn the response, I should first ask for confirmation. Then, if they agree, proceed to store using the memory tool. If not, just acknowledge without storing.\n</think>\n\nWould you like me to remember that you like hummus?"
