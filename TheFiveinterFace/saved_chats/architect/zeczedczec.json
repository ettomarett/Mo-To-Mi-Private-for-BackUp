Let me check if there's any relevant memory stored.\n\nLooking at the memory entries, there's a user_preference_eggs indicating they like eggs. Maybe I can mention that to personalize the response. But since the user just said \"hi\", maybe it's better to keep it simple first. I'll greet them and ask how I can assist. Also, I can note their preference for eggs in case they want to talk about that. Let me make sure to use a warm tone and invite them to ask for help.\n</think>\n\nHello! Welcome back. I see you previously mentioned you like eggs - is there something egg-related or other food preferences you'd like to discuss today? How can I assist you?"
