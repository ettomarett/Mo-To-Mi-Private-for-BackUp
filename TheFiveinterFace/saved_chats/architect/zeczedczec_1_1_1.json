Let me check if there's any relevant memory stored.\n\nLooking at the memory entries, there's a user_preference_eggs indicating they like eggs. Maybe I can mention that to personalize the response. But since the user just said \"hi\", maybe it's better to keep it simple first. I'll greet them and ask how I can assist. Also, I can note their preference for eggs in case they want to talk about that. Let me make sure to use a warm tone and invite them to ask for help.\n</think>\n\nHello! Welcome back. I see you previously mentioned you like eggs - is there something egg-related or other food preferences you'd like to discuss today? How can I assist you?"

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user mentioned they like mango. My job is to remember that. Let me check the tools available. The memory tool can store this information. The key should be something like \"user_preference_mango\" to keep it consistent with the existing \"user_preference_eggs\". The content would be \"User likes mango\". I need to format the tool call correctly using the mcp syntax.\n\nWait, the user already said \"i like mango\" and I responded by using the memory tool to store it. Then the system provided the result that it was stored successfully. Now, the user is asking for the final response based on that tool result. So I should confirm that the preference was stored and maybe suggest something related to mangoes and eggs. Maybe offer to talk about recipes or nutritional info. Make it friendly with emojis. Alright, that makes sense. Let me put that together.\n</think>\n\nI've stored your preference for mangoes in memory! Now I know you like both eggs \ud83e\udd5a and mangoes \ud83e\udd6d. Would you like to discuss recipes, nutritional information, or anything else related to these foods?"

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user just said \"hi\" again. Let me check the conversation history.\n\nEarlier, they mentioned liking eggs, mango, and pizza. I stored those in memory. Then when they said \"i like mango\", I confirmed storing it and mentioned both eggs and mangoes. Now they're greeting again with \"hi\".\n\nI should acknowledge their return and reference their stored preferences to keep the conversation engaging. Let me check the memory again to confirm. The user_preference_pizza, user_preference_mango, and user_preference_eggs are all there. \n\nSince they've already mentioned mango and eggs, maybe I can ask if they want to talk more about those or perhaps pizza. Or offer help with something else. Need to be friendly and proactive based on their interests.\n</think>\n\nWelcome back! I remember you enjoy pizza \ud83c\udf55, mangoes \ud83e\udd6d, and eggs \ud83e\udd5a. Would you like to explore recipes, food pairings, or nutritional facts related to these favorites today? Or is there something new you'd like to discuss?"

The key should be something like user_preference_cucumber, and the content is \"User likes cucumber\". I'll format the tool call correctly.\n\nWait, the user already mentioned mango, pizza, and eggs before. So adding cucumber to their preferences. After storing, I should confirm it's stored and suggest related topics. Maybe recipes, health benefits, or combinations with their other liked foods. Like cucumber-mango salad or adding cucumber to pizza. That would be helpful and engaging. Make sure the response is friendly and offers options. Alright, the tool result came back successful, so proceed to the final response.\n</think>\n\nGot it! \ud83e\udd52 Now stored with your other favorites: pizza \ud83c\udf55, mangoes \ud83e\udd6d, eggs \ud83e\udd5a, and cucumber. Would you like to explore refreshing cucumber recipes, learn about their health benefits, or discuss interesting food combinations (like cucumber-mango salad or cucumber-topped pizza)?"
