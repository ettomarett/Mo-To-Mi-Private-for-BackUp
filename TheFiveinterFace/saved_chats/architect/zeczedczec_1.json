Let me check if there's any relevant memory stored.\n\nLooking at the memory entries, there's a user_preference_eggs indicating they like eggs. Maybe I can mention that to personalize the response. But since the user just said \"hi\", maybe it's better to keep it simple first. I'll greet them and ask how I can assist. Also, I can note their preference for eggs in case they want to talk about that. Let me make sure to use a warm tone and invite them to ask for help.\n</think>\n\nHello! Welcome back. I see you previously mentioned you like eggs - is there something egg-related or other food preferences you'd like to discuss today? How can I assist you?"

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user mentioned they like mango. My job is to remember that. Let me check the tools available. The memory tool can store this information. The key should be something like \"user_preference_mango\" to keep it consistent with the existing \"user_preference_eggs\". The content would be \"User likes mango\". I need to format the tool call correctly using the mcp syntax.\n\nWait, the user already said \"i like mango\" and I responded by using the memory tool to store it. Then the system provided the result that it was stored successfully. Now, the user is asking for the final response based on that tool result. So I should confirm that the preference was stored and maybe suggest something related to mangoes and eggs. Maybe offer to talk about recipes or nutritional info. Make it friendly with emojis. Alright, that makes sense. Let me put that together.\n</think>\n\nI've stored your preference for mangoes in memory! Now I know you like both eggs \ud83e\udd5a and mangoes \ud83e\udd6d. Would you like to discuss recipes, nutritional information, or anything else related to these foods?"
