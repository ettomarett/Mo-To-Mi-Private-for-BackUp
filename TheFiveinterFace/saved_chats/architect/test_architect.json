The memory has some entries about message counts, but they might be from previous interactions. Since the user greeted me, I should respond politely. Maybe say hello and ask how I can assist them today. I don't need any tools for this response. Keep it friendly and open-ended.\n</think>\n\nHello! How can I assist you today?"
