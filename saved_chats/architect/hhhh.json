I remember from the memory that the user likes pizza, mango, and eggs. Maybe I can mention that to show I remember their preferences. Let me make sure to use the memory tool to retrieve those details. Wait, the memory entries are already listed here, so I don't need to call the tool again. I can just reference them directly. So I'll greet them and mention their preferences. Keep it friendly and offer help.\n</think>\n\nHello! How can I assist you today? I remember you like pizza, mango, and eggs - let me know if you'd like any recipes or recommendations related to those preferences! \ud83d\ude0a"
