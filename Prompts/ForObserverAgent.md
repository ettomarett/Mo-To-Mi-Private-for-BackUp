I need you to analyze a Spring Boot monolithic application located at [PATH_TO_MONOLITH] and identify potential microservice boundaries. 

Please follow this process:
1. Set up a new analysis project called "[PROJECT_NAME]"
2. Parse the Java source code to extract its structure
3. Analyze the dependencies between classes and packages
4. Generate visualizations of the dependency relationships
5. Create a comprehensive report with your findings

In your analysis, focus on:
- Identifying natural domain boundaries based on package structure
- Locating Spring components (@Service, @Repository, @Controller, @Entity)
- Detecting highly coupled areas that might be challenging to separate
- Suggesting logical microservice boundaries with justification

After completing the analysis, please provide:
- A summary of your key findings
- Your recommended microservice boundaries with reasoning
- Any potential challenges for migration
- Technical debt concerns that might impact the process

Use your Java Analyzer tool to perform this analysis systematically and present your conclusions clearly.
