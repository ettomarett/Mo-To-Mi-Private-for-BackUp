# Mo-To-Mi: Multi-Agent AI Architecture

## Overview

Mo-To-Mi implements a specialized 5-agent architecture for Spring Boot monolith to microservices migration. This approach divides the complex migration process into distinct, specialized roles while maintaining overall coordination through a supervisor agent.

## The 5-Agent Architecture

### 1. AI Supervisor (The Architect)
- **Role**: The brain of the operation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - 🧠 Orchestrates and monitors all other agents
  - 📖 Tracks success/failure metrics
  - 🔁 Rewrites prompts or reorders tasks based on context
  - 🧠 Learns migration heuristics over time
  - 📊 Maintains holistic view of the migration process
  - 🔄 Handles error recovery and strategy adaptation

### 2. Analyzer Agent (The Observer)
- **Role**: Understands the monolith's structure
- **Responsibilities**:
  - 📦 Analyzes the Spring Boot monolith's domain structure
  - 🔍 Detects module coupling, data access patterns
  - 🗺️ Extracts service boundaries and communication maps
  - 📊 Identifies potential bounded contexts
  - 🔎 Detects anti-patterns like God classes and shared database access
  - 📈 Produces dependency graphs and heatmaps

### 3. Planner Agent (The Strategist)
- **Role**: Creates the migration blueprint
- **Responsibilities**:
  - 🧩 Designs microservice decomposition strategy
  - 📜 Outputs interface contracts (REST, events)
  - 🗃️ Suggests database splits and migration patterns
  - 🔀 Recommends API Gateway usage
  - 📝 Develops Strangler Fig pattern implementation
  - ⏱️ Creates phased migration timeline

### 4. Coder Agent (The Builder)
- **Role**: Generates implementation code
- **Responsibilities**:
  - 💻 Generates microservice scaffolds (Spring Boot)
  - 🔧 Configures Dockerfiles, Spring Cloud, Eureka, etc.
  - ⚙️ Produces gateway routes, DB adapters, message handlers
  - 📦 Creates CI/CD pipeline configurations
  - 🔄 Implements database migration scripts
  - 🏗️ Develops service mesh configurations

### 5. Tester Agent (The Validator)
- **Role**: Verifies migration correctness
- **Responsibilities**:
  - 🧪 Generates and runs tests:
    - Unit/integration tests (JUnit + TestContainers)
    - Functional equivalence checks (old vs new)
    - API contract tests
  - 🧠 Compares payloads, database states
  - 🔙 Triggers rollback or snapshot restore if needed
  - 📊 Reports test coverage and validation results
  - 🔍 Performs security and performance validation

## Implementation Strategy

Each agent operates as a specialized LLM instance with:
- Domain-specific system prompts
- Access to relevant tools and resources
- Knowledge base integration specific to its role
- Custom retrieval augmentation for its specialty

The AI Supervisor maintains the state of the overall process and coordinates the execution flow based on the results from each agent.

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of migration
2. **Adaptability**: The architecture can adjust to different monolith structures
3. **Quality Control**: Built-in validation with the Tester agent
4. **Continuous Learning**: The Supervisor improves the process over time
5. **Error Recovery**: Rollback capabilities when issues are detected

## Integration with Existing Tools

This architecture integrates with:
- Our TestContainers documentation for testing
- SonarQube for code quality assessment
- GitOps processes for deployment
- Docker/Kubernetes for containerization
- Spring Cloud for microservice patterns
