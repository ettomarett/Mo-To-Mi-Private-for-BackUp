# Monolithic to Microservices Migration Plan

## Phase 1: Target Application Selection

Let's focus on a specific application type:

1. **Spring Boot Java Monoliths**
   - Widely used in enterprise environments
   - Clear package structure makes boundary identification easier
   - Well-documented migration patterns already exist
   - Large community and resources available

## Phase 2: Research & Knowledge Base

1. **Gather Migration Best Practices**
   - Strangler Fig Pattern implementation
   - Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
   - Database decomposition strategies
   - API Gateway patterns

2. **DevOps Infrastructure Research**
   - Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
   - CI/CD pipelines for microservices
   - Service discovery solutions
   - Monitoring and observability tools

3. **Common Challenges Documentation**
   - Distributed transactions management
   - Service-to-service communication
   - Data consistency issues
   - Authentication/authorization across services

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation

We've adopted a specialized 5-agent architecture for our migration system:

1. **AI Supervisor Agent (The Architect)**
   - Orchestrates the entire migration process
   - Coordinates other agents and maintains state
   - Tracks success/failure metrics
   - Continuously improves migration strategies

2. **Analyzer Agent (The Observer)**
   - Performs static code analysis of monolith
   - Identifies module dependencies and coupling
   - Extracts service boundaries and bounded contexts
   - Maps data access patterns and API usage

3. **Planner Agent (The Strategist)**
   - Designs microservice decomposition strategy
   - Creates interface contracts between services
   - Develops database splitting strategy
   - Plans phased migration approach (Strangler Fig)

4. **Coder Agent (The Builder)**
   - Generates microservice code scaffolds
   - Creates Docker/Kubernetes configurations
   - Implements API gateway routing
   - Produces database migration scripts

5. **Tester Agent (The Validator)**
   - Creates and runs validation test suites
   - Ensures functional equivalence between old and new
   - Performs integration testing
   - Enables rollback if issues are detected

## Phase 4: Implementation Roadmap

1. **Month 1-2: Foundation & Analysis Agents**
   - Implement AI Supervisor framework
   - Develop Analyzer agent capabilities
   - Create knowledge base integration

2. **Month 3-4: Planning & Coding Agents**
   - Implement Planner agent with strategy generation
   - Develop Coder agent with scaffolding capabilities
   - Build integration between planning and implementation

3. **Month 5-6: Testing & Refinement**
   - Implement Tester agent with validation framework
   - Integrate complete agent workflow
   - Test on sample applications and refine

## Success Criteria

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Accurate identification of service boundaries
2. **Effective Planning**: Practical migration strategies that minimize risk
3. **Quality Implementation**: Generated code follows best practices
4. **Robust Testing**: Thorough validation of migrated services
5. **Process Improvement**: System learns and improves with each migration
