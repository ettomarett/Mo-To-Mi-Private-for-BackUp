# Monolithic to Microservices Migration Plan

## Phase 1: Target Application Selection

Let's focus on a specific application type:

1. **Spring Boot Java Monoliths**
   - Widely used in enterprise environments
   - Clear package structure makes boundary identification easier
   - Well-documented migration patterns already exist
   - Large community and resources available

## Phase 2: Research & Knowledge Base

1. **Gather Migration Best Practices**
   - Strangler Fig Pattern implementation
   - Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
   - Database decomposition strategies
   - API Gateway patterns

2. **DevOps Infrastructure Research**
   - Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
   - CI/CD pipelines for microservices
   - Service discovery solutions
   - Monitoring and observability tools

3. **Common Challenges Documentation**
   - Distributed transactions management
   - Service-to-service communication
   - Data consistency issues
   - Authentication/authorization across services

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation

We've adopted a specialized 5-agent architecture for our migration system:

1. **AI Supervisor Agent (The Architect)**
   - Orchestrates the entire migration process
   - Coordinates other agents and maintains state
   - Tracks success/failure metrics
   - Continuously improves migration strategies

2. **Analyzer Agent (The Observer)**
   - Performs static code analysis of monolith
   - Identifies module dependencies and coupling
   - Extracts service boundaries and bounded contexts
   - Maps data access patterns and API usage

3. **Planner Agent (The Strategist)**
   - Designs microservice decomposition strategy
   - Creates interface contracts between services
   - Develops database splitting strategy
   - Plans phased migration approach (Strangler Fig)

4. **Coder Agent (The Builder)**
   - Generates microservice code scaffolds
   - Creates Docker/Kubernetes configurations
   - Implements API gateway routing
   - Produces database migration scripts

5. **Tester Agent (The Validator)**
   - Creates and runs validation test suites
   - Ensures functional equivalence between old and new
   - Performs integration testing
   - Enables rollback if issues are detected

## Phase 4: Implementation Roadmap

1. **Month 1-2: Foundation & Analysis Agents**
   - Implement AI Supervisor framework
   - Develop Analyzer agent capabilities
   - Create knowledge base integration

2. **Month 3-4: Planning & Coding Agents**
   - Implement Planner agent with strategy generation
   - Develop Coder agent with scaffolding capabilities
   - Build integration between planning and implementation

3. **Month 5-6: Testing & Refinement**
   - Implement Tester agent with validation framework
   - Integrate complete agent workflow
   - Test on sample applications and refine

## Success Criteria

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Accurate identification of service boundaries
2. **Effective Planning**: Practical migration strategies that minimize risk
3. **Quality Implementation**: Generated code follows best practices
4. **Robust Testing**: Thorough validation of migrated services
5. **Process Improvement**: System learns and improves with each migration

See [Multi-Agent Architecture](./multi_agent_architecture.md) for detailed documentation on our agent-based approach.

### Next Steps

1. **Agent Capability Enhancement**
   - [ ] Implement specialized tools for the Observer agent to analyze Java code structure
   - [ ] Develop DDD boundary detection algorithms for the Observer agent
   - [ ] Create microservice planning templates for the Strategist agent
   - [ ] Integrate code generation tools for the Builder agent
   - [ ] Implement testing framework integration for the Validator agent

2. **Memory System Optimization**
   - [ ] Develop inter-agent memory sharing capabilities for critical information
   - [ ] Implement memory tagging system for better categorization
   - [ ] Create memory visualization tools for better insights
   - [ ] Add automated memory cleanup for outdated information

3. **Knowledge Base Development**
   - [ ] Build comprehensive knowledge base of Spring Boot migration patterns
   - [ ] Integrate knowledge base with agents through retrieval-augmented generation
   - [ ] Create example migration projects for testing and demonstration

4. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Implement the ability to import Spring Boot monolith source code
   - [ ] Develop visual dependency mapping for module relationships
   - [ ] Create automated service boundary recommendation system
   - [ ] Implement code generation for microservice scaffolding
   - [ ] Add CI/CD template generation for new microservices

5. **Evaluation and Refinement**
   - [ ] Test the system on real-world Spring Boot monoliths
   - [ ] Gather feedback on agent effectiveness and accuracy
   - [ ] Refine agent prompts and tools based on performance
   - [ ] Measure system against success criteria

Our next immediate focus should be on developing specialized tools for each agent, particularly the Observer agent's ability to analyze Java code structures, as this forms the foundation for the rest of the migration process. In parallel, we should enhance the memory system's tagging and inter-agent sharing capabilities to allow for better collaboration between agents.

The recent migration to agent-specific memory banks is a significant step forward, enabling each agent to maintain its own specialized knowledge base without cross-contamination. This prepares us for the next phase of development where each agent will need to store and retrieve domain-specific information.
