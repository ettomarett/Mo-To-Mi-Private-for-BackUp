- [ ] Create agent-specific retrieval augmentation
- [ ] Build feedback loops for continuous improvement

### Week 19-20: User Interface Development
- [ ] Create dashboard for migration progress
- [ ] Implement visualization of agent activities
- [ ] Develop user interaction points for critical decisions
- [ ] Build reporting system for migration metrics

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Weeks 21-24)

### Week 21-22: Test Framework Development
- [ ] Identify 3-5 open-source Spring monoliths for testing
- [ ] Create evaluation framework for migration suggestions
- [ ] Develop metrics for measuring migration success
- [ ] Build automated testing pipeline

### Week 23-24: Pilot Testing
- [ ] Run complete 5-agent system against test monoliths
- [ ] Evaluate accuracy of each agent's outputs
- [ ] Test end-to-end migration workflow
- [ ] Measure effectiveness of the integrated system

## Phase 5: Refinement & Documentation (Weeks 25-26)

### Week 25-26: Final Refinement & Release
- [ ] Address identified weaknesses in agent system
- [ ] Optimize inter-agent communication
- [ ] Create comprehensive user documentation
- [ ] Prepare case studies from test applications
- [ ] Release initial version with complete documentation

## Success Metrics
- All 5 agents function effectively in their specialized roles
- End-to-end migration process runs with minimal human intervention
- Generated service boundaries align with expert recommendations
- Code quality of generated microservices meets industry standards
- Testing and validation processes ensure functional equivalence
- Rollback mechanisms function correctly when issues are detected

## Future Enhancements (Post-Release)
- Add specialized agents for additional monolith frameworks (.NET, Django, Rails)
- Implement machine learning for improved boundary detection
- Create visual migration progress dashboard
- Develop specialized agents for domain-specific migrations (finance, healthcare, etc.)
- Build a knowledge sharing system between different migration projects
